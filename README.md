<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

 - Download `XAMPP` software from [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) as it is required to run an Apache HTTP Server.
 - Need to install PHP 5.3 or upper version. We can download PHP from [here](https://www.php.net/downloads.php)
 - Download the MySQL database from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=486088)
 - Download the latest version of phpMyAdmin software tool from [here](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) 

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   https://github.com/Xer0Bytes/Project-Tento.git
   ```
2. Start the Apache HTTP server
3. Go to:
   ```sh
   http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`
   ```
4. Click on the `databases` tab and create a database named `tentodatabase`
5. Import the `tentodatabase.sql` from `database/` folder
6. From the cloned repo, copy the folder named `code` and paste it in the `htdocs` folder of where you installed `XAMPP`
7. Go to the following link to browse the locally hosted project:
   ```sh
   http://localhost/code/frontend/landingPage/landingPage.html
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The project can be used in the following ways:

1. We can create a user profile and customise it to our liking.

2. We can log in as a user and give an MCQ exam based on a topic of our choosing as well as the number of Questions and Time.
    * User can use an untimed mode - there will be no timers and users will also be aided with the help of a hint button
    * User can use a timed mode - to help simulate the environment of an exam
    * User may also choose the number of questions they would like to test themselves on - a recommended time for that amount of questions would be shown but the user may change it if it is not desirable
    * If the user is in a hurry, he or she can also use the default mode to give an exam which contains a set number of questions and time limit.

3. We can watch our improvement and progress using the User History button.

4. We can also compare our progress with users around the world by looking at the Ranking Page.

5. If the user wishes to, he or she can also delete their account or reset their account.

6. Another thing to not worry about is forgetting your password since there is an option to reset it using your email._
